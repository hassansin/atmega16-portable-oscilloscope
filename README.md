ATmega16 Portable Oscilloscope
================================

Features:
-------------------------

* 128x64 pixel on board monochrome Graphic LCD display for viewing the signal shapes.
* Single Channel Input
* It has an external EEPROM to save the current wave data. This signal shape can be restored at later without the input signal.
* Simple menu to select options, thus reducing the number of physical buttons
* time/div , volt/div. horizontal and vertical sweep, AC/DC mode, GND adjusting, freeze mode etc .
* Can be used as frequency meter too.
* Instead of on-board LCD the output can also be viewed in the PC. Various simulation software like Matlab can be used to analysis the input signal in real-time.
* Currently the input can be up to 10Khz and 10volt p-p. But there is much scope to expand the input range in future.
